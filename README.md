# POLUnpack - PlayOnline PE Unpacker

POLUnpack is a utility for unpacking Square Enix's PlayOnline custom-packed binaries.

It outputs a clean PE binary without any of the POL1 packer cruft.

## Usage
1. Build from source or download from releases.
2. Example usage: polunpack "C:\FFXiMain.dll" "C:\FFXiMain_unpacked.dll"
